This project primarily follows the style and formatting rules outlined by Prettier: https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html.

We set up Prettier as a VSCode plugin by Googling "vscode prettier", visiting https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode, clicking "Install", giving VSCode permission to open, and again clicking "Install". We then configured Prettier using the auto-format keyboard shortcut Shift/Option/F, which presented the option to use Prettier for the default formatting rules.
